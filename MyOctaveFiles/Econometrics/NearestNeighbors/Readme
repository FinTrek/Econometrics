nearest_neighbors.m is an interface to a simple C program that uses ANN to find exact 
nearest neighbors. The C executable is ann_sample, made using the patched ANN code.

The modification to the ANN source code is in the file ./sample/ann_sample.cpp

Make ANN as usual, then copy ann_sample from ANN/bin/ann_sample to some place in your path.


knn_fit and knn_density are old functions that used the SWIG bindings to ANN. They need to be updated
to use nearest_neighbors.m (easy to do)
