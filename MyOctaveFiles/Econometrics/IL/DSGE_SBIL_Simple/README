Simple code to illustrate the DSGE example from Creel and Kristensen
(2013) "Indirect Likelihood Inference". This code does not use
parallelization, so it is somewhat slow and is intended to be
illustrative. Production code that uses MPI to execute on a cluster
is available from the authors.

To use this, just run DSGE_SBIL_Simple from the Matlab/Octave prompt.
You must have Dynare installed.

IF RUNNING PELICANHPC: type "UseDynare" at octave prompt before running
the script. This simply adds dynare to the octave path.

This example code uses a very small number of simulations and
Monte Carlo replications, just to show how things work. To get
better results, you need to increase the number of simulations, S.
To do that, edit the main file, DSGE_SBIL_Simple.m. You might also
increase the number of Monte Carlo replications.

Special thanks to Johannes Pfeifer for help in making the code run
on Matlab, and for some very nice hints to speed up execution.
