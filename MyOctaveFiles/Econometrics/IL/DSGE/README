This directory contains files to replicate results in "Indirect Likelihood Inference" by
Michael Creel and Dennis Kristensen. 

These files allow estimation of the DSGE model, using the first design, with a sample 
size of n=160. The files replicate the results in Table 3.

The files generate only 20 Monte Carlo replications, and use a small number of simulations
S=100. You should expect more bias than is presented in Table 3, because S is too small.
This is done so that you can see results reasonably quickly. To get more reliable results,
modify the file 'runme' at the indicated place to increase the variable 'reps'.

These files require Dynare, and the ANN software of Arya and Mount, modified to work with
GNU Octave. The easiest way to run this example is to obtain the PelicanHPC Linux distribution
(a live CD image file), which has all software pre-installed. Then run PelicanHPC using
virtualization software (e.g., Virtualbox, which is free). You do not need to use Linux to do this,
it works with Linux, Windows, and MacOS. The steps are

1. Install Virtualbox (http://www.virtualbox.org) or another virtualization package for your
   operating system.
2. Download the most recent PelicanHPC image (http://pareto.uab.es/mcreel/PelicanHPC).
3. Boot PelicanHPC in a virtual machine.
4. go to the /home/user/Econometrics/IL/DSGE directory, open a terminal, and type './runme'.

With that, you will obtain results similar to those presented in the paper.
