This directory contains files to replicate the results in Creel and Kristensen
"Indirect Likelihood Inference" (the 2011 working paper version) pertaining to
the fully observed DSGE model. There is a newer version of the paper, which
has a somewhat more interesting DSGE model, for which example code is also
available.

These files will create a file of  theta / Z_n  pairs, where theta is the
parameter of the model and Z_n is the auxiliary statistic. 

Notes:
1. propagate and runme are executable scripts. They need to be edited to use
the correct number of MPI ranks. Set this to the total number of cores in your
cluster, plus 1. Then execute " runme"
2. there is a line in "runme" for using this on PelicanHPC: uncomment it and
comment the preceding line, if you're using this on PelicanHPC
3. you can set the number of replications to draw from the sample
space and the number of Monte Carlo replications in make_simdata.m
The default values are very low, to limit the time needed for computations.
The SBIL estimator will have more bias than what is reported in the paper
due to the small number of replications of draws from the parameter space.
Increase this as much as you like, though be aware that it becomes time
consuming.
