To use the code in this directory, you need to have Octave and MPI.
The easiest way is to run it on PelicanHPC, which has everything installed.

* edit make_simdata.m to choose sample size, and number of simulations, S.
* execute "mpirun -np X --hostfile /home/user/tmp/bhost octave --eval make_simdata"
	where X is the total number of cores in your cluster.
* when that's done, execute "octave --eval Results"
