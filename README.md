# Econometrics
Michael Creel's graduate level econometrics notes, example code, and support programs
- to get just the notes, click on econometrics.pdf, and then on Download, at the upper R of the page, which will download only the pdf. Links in the pdf point to files here on github, and will open in your browser.
- to run the examples, get this repo, and also the Econometrics.jl package from https://github.com/mcreel/Econometrics.jl

## There are a couple of unusual thing about these notes:
- they are available in editable form (econometrics.lyx), so that you can modify them to suit your needs: see www.lyx.org. 
- they contain links that point to example programs using the Julia language. An older version (release 1.0)
used GNU Octave, and was copyrighted GPL. The current version is being adapted to use Julia for the majority of the examples, and uses the MIT license.
