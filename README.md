# Econometrics
Graduate level econometrics notes and example code
- to get just the notes, click on econometrics.pdf, and then on Download, at the upper R of the page, which will download only the pdf. Links in the pdf point to files here on github, and will open in your browser.
- to run the examples:
    * get this repo
    * get the support code by executing Pkg.clone("https://github.com/mcreel/Econometrics.jl.git")
    from the Julia prompt.


## There are a couple of unusual thing about these notes:
- they are available in editable form (econometrics.lyx), so that you can modify them to suit your needs: seethe first chapter for more information, and get LyX from  www.lyx.org. 
- they contain links that point to example programs using the Julia language. An older version (release 1.0)
used GNU Octave, and was copyrighted GPL. The current version is being adapted to use Julia for the majority of the examples, and uses the MIT license.

MOVING TO JULIA is a work in progress! It should be done by the end of the year.
