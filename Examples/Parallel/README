The directories
	bootstrap
	gmm
	kernel
	mle
	montecarlo
	pea
all contain parallel examples for octave that use MPITB.

MPITB (with tutorial and source code) is in /usr/local/share/octave/site-m

INFORMATION on how to use MPITB's DEBUG mode
You need to configure things so that the slave nodes can forward
xterms to the master node. Once you do this, you can observe on the
master node what is going on on the slaves. The steps to do this are:
1) do the normal PK setup
2) open a konsole terminal
3) type "xhost +"
4) type ssh node1 xterm -display node1:0
5) in the xterm that opens up, cd to the relevant directory in the working
   directory, and start Octave. DEBUG mode is working.

NOTE: kernel_example1.m example in ./Octave/kernel/ is prepared to
show how this works. None of the other examples use DEBUG at the moment.
