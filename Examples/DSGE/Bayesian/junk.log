Estimation using a non linear filter!

You are using a gradient-based mode-finder. Particle filtering introduces discontinuities in the
objective function w.r.t the parameters. Thus, should use a non-gradient based optimizer.

Please choose a mode-finder:
	 0 - Continue using gradient-based method (it is most likely that you will no get any sensible result).
	 6 - Monte Carlo based algorithm
	 7 - Nelder-Mead simplex based optimization routine (Matlab optimization toolbox required)
	 8 - Nelder-Mead simplex based optimization routine (Dynare's implementation)
	 9 - CMA-ES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy) algorithm
Please enter your choice: 9
