To prepare the software in this directory for use, you must
have Octave installed. Octave v4.0 or more recent is recommended.

If you are using this on your own Linux distro, open a terminal,
and type "setup_econometrics" to prepare the software. You need
to have the gcc compiler and build libraries installed for this
to work.

Last step is to include the Econometrics directory in your Octave
run path.
