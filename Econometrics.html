    This page contains information about <a
      href="http://pareto.uab.es/mcreel/">Michael Creel</a>'s graduate
    level econometrics notes. There are a couple of unusual thing about
    these notes:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>they are available in editable form, so that you can modify
        them to suit your needs. They are however copyrighted, so you
        should learn about the <a
          href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a> before
        modifying and distributing them.<br>
      </li>
      <li>they contain links that point to <a
          href="http://pareto.uab.es/mcreel/Econometrics/Examples">example









          programs</a> using the <a href="http://www.octave.org/">Octave</a>
        matrix programming language. Octave sometimes gets little
        respect as a language for econometrics, with allegations that it
        is slow compared to Matlab, etc. A couple of points:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>for plain Octave, these allegations are true, in some
          respects at least<br>
        </li>
        <li>Octave is free, and it runs on all popular operating systems<br>
        </li>
        <li>plain Octave is perfectly good for ordinary econometrics of
          the sort that most students and many researchers need to do</li>
        <li>Octave can easily be linked to parallel matrix algebra
          libraries so that it uses all cores of a computer. Plain
          Octave doesn't do that by default.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Octave can be compiled using proprietary compilers, if you
          have them.<br>
        </li>
        <li>it is easy to use C++ code for bottlenecks. For serious
          research work on computationally demanding problems, this step
          is fundamental<br>
        </li>
        <li>it is easy to use OpenMP or MPI to use Octave for parallel
          computing. This can have a great performance effect, and your
          code is free and portable.</li>
        <li>if you use these methods, you can get very good performance
          with Octave.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>&nbsp;There are examples for stuff like OLS, ML, etc., but
        there is also working (GPL'd) code for&nbsp;nonparametric
        methods, simulation-based estimation methods, estimation of DSGE
        models, and parallel programming applications in econometrics.
        The examples make use of some other code for GNU Octave that I
        have written - minimizers and other stuff, <a
          href="http://pareto.uab.es/mcreel/Econometrics/MyOctaveFiles">available









          here</a>.<br>
      </li>
      <li>the example programs together with data and all needed
        software are on the accompanying <a
          href="http://pareto.uab.es/mcreel/Econometrics/econometrics.iso">econometrics.iso</a>
        image. This is an ISO image which can be used to boot a
        computer, but which is more easily used to boot a virtual
        computer, running under your usual operating system. This works
        with all of the popular operating systems. Using this method,
        you can be running the examples in very little time, without the
        hassle of installing a lot of software.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    You may be wondering why the notes are available in this form. It's
    simply because I use a lot of free software, and this is a means of
    contributing back to the community. Also, I'm hoping to receive
    error corrections and contributions from users of the notes.<br>

    <ul>
      <li>the <a
          href="http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/aubautbar/575.03.htm">notes</a>,
        in pdf form.</li>
      <li>all of the sources for the notes and examples are directly
        available <a
          href="http://pareto.uab.es/mcreel/Econometrics/Econometrics.tgz">here</a>
        (gzipped tar file) and <a
          href="http://pareto.uab.es/mcreel/Econometrics/Econometrics.zip">here</a>
        (zip file). To run the examples, you need to have Octave
        installed. To edit the notes, you need to install LyX.</li>
      <li><a
          href="http://pareto.uab.es/mcreel/Econometrics/econometrics.iso">econometrics.iso</a>
        (about 1.3GB) contains the notes and all the <a
          href="http://pareto.uab.es/mcreel/Econometrics/Examples">examples</a>,
        ready to run. You don't need to install anything to use it
        (except a virtualization platform, if you don't have one
        installed). I test the image using <a
          href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">Virtualbox</a>,
        which is a free download for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. There is
        an appliance <a
          href="http://pareto.uab.es/mcreel/Econometrics/econometrics.ova">econometrics.ova</a>.
        To use the ISO image in a virtual machine, import the .ova
        appliance file into Virtualbox, then in Settings, make the
        Storage-&gt;IDE controller point to the location where you have
        save the econometrics.iso file. If you would like the scripts
        used to build this image, they are <a
          href="http://pareto.uab.es/mcreel/Econometrics/EconometricsISO.tgz">here</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    A bit more detail: The notes are written using the <a
      href="http://www.lyx.org/">LyX</a> word processor, which allows
    export to LaTeX. The document is about 500 pages. Coverage is&nbsp;
    2 semesters of econometric theory, emphasizing models for stationary
    data. <br>
